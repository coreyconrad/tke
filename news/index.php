              	<h2 id="sec1">Fall 2015 Candidate Class</h2>
              	<p>
                This fall’s IFC rush brought about a group of engaged men who are ready to change the negative stigma of fraternity life and propel this colony to its chartering goal. The picture above was taken shortly after our first induction ceremony of the semester. Candidates Will Baker, Zhane Roberts, Kyle Brown, Daniel Walton, Ryan Wilcauskas, Russell Burrell and Jeffrey Toler were the first to be inducted.</p> 
				<p>We are currently in the process of scheduling our second induction of this semester in which we will induct three more candidates: Jordan Reep, Bradley Kostensky, and Angelo Grisby. In the meantime, each candidate will be working with their assigned big brothers to fulfill the new member education program in order to be initiated into the fraternity. We have big expectations for this class of individuals who have already proven that they are excited about TKE and eager to be a part of it.</p>
				<p>While we have already made great strides in recruiting this semester we still have yet to reach our goal for chartering. Our recruitment chairman, Frater Dylan John, has instilled a sense of urgency in these candidates to reach that goal. As a result, we have seen our candidates working hard to recruit more candidates and are proud of the effort all around. The colony will once again employ the “TKE’s Top 20” strategy to recruit the top 20 men at Georgia Southern in terms of service, academics, and character. With the help of our new candidate class, we believe our chance to charter this semester is stronger than it has ever been before.

              	<p>
                Thanks to a combined effort from our active members and our alumni, the Lambda Upsilon Colony’s philanthropy event “Save the Change for St. Jude” raised the second most money for charity in all of TKE nation and 1st among collegiate groups. We were able to raise an astounding $4,270.40 by having Greek organizations, students, faculty, alumni, active brothers, and other individuals pledge to save their change from purchases they make and donate it to St. Jude. </p>
				<p>Thanks to the success of the philanthropy, we have decided to make “Save the Change” our annual philanthropy event to be held each spring semester. As always, our main goal is to raise as much money as possible to make sure that St. Jude’s promise, to make no family pay for cancer treatment, is fulfilled. We believe that although this was an amazing start for our philanthropy, we can raise more money for St. Jude next spring to become the #1 Chapter in TKE Nation. We would like to thank everyone who helped make this milestone possible by donating.

				<p>
      			Upon the transfer of Frater Caleb Hunter, our Epiprytanis position became vacant. Frater Jeremy Sklar, formerly the Grammateus, served as interim Epiprytanis and was officially elected to the role earlier this semester. Elections were then held for the newly vacated Grammateus position in which Frater Kyle Mantay was the victor. Both fraters will serve as officers in their respective positions until the end of the semester.
                </p>
              	<h2>Chairmen</h2>
				<p>
      			The start of the new school year brought about many changes to our chairmen and committees. Frater Michael Jenkins was appointed as the new Service chairman thanks to his efforts in the community to serve. Frater Josh Halaberda is the sole Philanthropy Chairman because of Frater Dylan John’s appointment to Recruitment Chairman based on his efforts with TKE’s Top 20. Frater Thomas Carden will now handle the role of Social Media Chairman. Fraters Corey Conrad and Derrick Ramage will maintain their roles as Athletics and Social Chairman.
